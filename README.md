# Final-project
The code is best used in the terminal with command line arguments. The virtual box is the best machine to use with this code, just for simplicity's sake.
This code is based on the assignment that we used linked lists to create a communications network. It has many new fuctions. The new fucntions includ:e counting the total citys in the list, counting the cities between two cities, deleting a city, showing the cities between two cites and a new function where when a message is transmitted the user has to type a reply that is then sent back to the head of the list. The main menue is very self explanatory but i encourage you to explore.
There are no dependencies for this code.
The code is both written as a file and stored as a .zip file here on github you can copy and paste the code or download the .zip.
Currently I have no problems with the code everything is working upon submission.
